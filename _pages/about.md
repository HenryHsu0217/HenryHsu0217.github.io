Just a normal master's student studying data science, witness the explosion of AI and Generative AI in my last year of my Bachelor, and got interested in how this technology works and decided to study data science. And the deeper I went in this area, the more I want to know, and I don't want to become those people I met whom blindly worship and follow the trend of AI, ending up looking to pursue a PhD in the future.
